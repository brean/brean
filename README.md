### Hi, I'm Andreas 👋

I am a Researcher and Software Engineer 👨‍💻 working at the [DFKI Robotics Innovation Center Bremen](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/) in the field of task planning for autonomous systems. The research projects I am involved in are [Hi-Digit Pro 4.0](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/hi-digit-pro-40.html) and [Knowledge4Retail](https://knowledge4retail.org/).

**As experienced mentor I am always happy to do workshops at your next Hackathon!**

When I am on the PC in my free time I like to do some Game Development🎮 or web-projects🌍 (some of that finds its way to the [Repositories](https://github.com/brean?tab=repositories) section here on github).
