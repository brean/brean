### Hi, I'm Andreas 👋

I am a Researcher and Software Engineer 👨‍💻 working at the [DFKI Robotics Innovation Center](http://dfki-bremen.de) in Bremen, Germany.

As experienced mentor I am always happy to do workshops at your next Hackathon!

I like to do some Game Development🎮 or web-projects🌍 in my free time (some of that finds its way to the repo section here on github).

Feel free to follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/datanonsense) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/datanonsense/)
