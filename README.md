### Hi, I'm Andreas 👋

I am a Researcher 👨‍💻 working at the [DFKI Robotics Innovation Center Bremen](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/) as leading Software Engineer in the research projects
 * [SeMoSys](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/semosys/) (in production robotics ⚙️) for autonomous task planning in aerospace production ✈️ and
 * [SAMLER-KI](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/samler-ki/) (in space robotics ✨) for robot navigation on the moon 🌕.

<!--
My interests are:
 * robots in space ✨
 * task and motion planning 🗺️
 * controling robot fleets over the internet 🌍
 * game development 🎮 (using game engines for robot simulation)
 * building robots 🤖
-->

When I am on the PC in my free time I like to do some Game Development🎮, web-projects🌍 or build/modify [robots](https://github.com/brean/my-robot-fleet) 🤖 (most of that finds its way to the [Repositories](https://github.com/brean?tab=repositories) section here on github).

#### 🎓 Thesis supervision

I am supervising **B.Sc./M.Sc. thesis**, ask me for topics if you want to write your thesis at DFKI in Bremen or remote!
