### Hi, I'm Andreas 👋

I am a Researcher and Software Engineer 👨‍💻 working at the [DFKI Robotics Innovation Center Bremen](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/) in the field of task planning for autonomous systems. The research projects I am involved in are [SeMoSys](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/semosys/) and [Knowledge4Retail](https://knowledge4retail.org/en/).

When I am on the PC in my free time I like to do some Game Development🎮, web-projects🌍 or build/modify robots 🤖 (most of that finds its way to the [Repositories](https://github.com/brean?tab=repositories) section here on github).

**I am always up for joining Game Jams and Hackathons as coach or participant** so feel free to contact me.
