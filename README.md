### Hi, I'm Andreas 👋

I am a Researcher and Software Engineer 👨‍💻 working at the [DFKI Robotics Innovation Center Bremen](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/) in the field of autonomous navigation and task planning. The research projects I am involved in are:
 * [SeMoSys](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/semosys/) for autonomous task planning in aerospace ✈️ and
 * [SAMLER-KI](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/samler-ki/) for robot navigation systems on the moon 🌕.

**If you are interested in algorithm optimization, have a strong programming background and want to work on optimizing robot navigation (Visual Odometry/SLAM) for the MOON contact me!**

When I am on the PC in my free time I like to do some Game Development🎮, web-projects🌍 or build/modify robots 🤖 (most of that finds its way to the [Repositories](https://github.com/brean?tab=repositories) section here on github).

**I am always up for joining Game Jams and Hackathons as coach or participant** so feel free to contact me.

My Global Game Jam profile can be found [here](https://globalgamejam.org/users/brean).
